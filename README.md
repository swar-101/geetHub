# geetHub 🎧  
A year-long journey to master sound, Ableton Live, and everything between science and creativity.

geetHub is my personal audio dojo.  
Every time I learn something in Ableton or sound theory, I capture it here through:
• Notes written in my own words  
• Screenshots from Ableton  
• Mini Ableton `.als` projects  
• Audio examples  
• Experiments and mistakes  
• Research logs  

The goal is simple:  
Turn knowledge into instinct.  
Reach SCL 3 in sound engineering and Ableton fluency.

## Structure Overview

### 1. physics-of-sound  
The true foundation.  
Waveforms, frequency, amplitude, phase, resonance, harmonics, envelopes, timbre, psychoacoustics.

### 2. digital-audio  
The science behind audio in computers.  
Sample rate, bit depth, aliasing, Nyquist, dithering, quantization, oversampling, noise shaping.

### 3. synthesis  
The art of generating sound.  
Subtractive, FM, wavetable, granular, additive, physical modeling.  
Each section includes notes, screenshots, and mini sound experiments.

### 4. mixing  
Tonal and dynamic balance.  
EQ, compression, saturation, gain staging, imaging, reverb, delay, and headroom.  
Real-world Ableton examples and A/B tests included.

### 5. fx  
Creative effects and vibe engineering.  
Delay, reverb, chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, micro-shifting, spatial tools, texture FX, modulation tricks, automation sorcery, and creative chains.

### 6. sound-design  
Textures, layers, character, macro programming, racks, presets, sound storytelling, resampling, transient design.

### 7. acoustics  
The environment side of sound.  
Room treatment, standing waves, monitoring setup, psychoacoustic truths, frequency perception.

### 8. mastering  
The final polish.  
LUFS, true peak, multiband compression, limiting, stereo width safety, translation across devices.

### 9. ableton-workflow  
Shortcuts, templates, racks, macro setups, custom devices, and speed-boosting techniques.  
This is my equivalent of IntelliJ sorcery for Ableton.

## Purpose  
geetHub is a living notebook — not a tutorial repo.  
Everything here is what I learn, what I test, and what I teach myself.  
Future me should be able to understand any topic from zero just by reading this.

I want to feel these concepts, not memorize them.  
I want to build intuition.  
I want to master sound.
